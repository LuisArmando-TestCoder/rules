# Area of improvement (sort of): don't use the non_statements when typing conditions
# Area of improvement: variable names are limited to 26ish, they need to be numbered so they can be infinite
# (although statements are not infinite unless 
# they are the reflection of an infinite reality, 
# but finite observers who get to be finite in the end, whitin that infinite "reality" [which only an observer can
# transform it into real as it categorizes it as such],
# don't need an infinite implementation, 
# but still it could be cool to have it, 
# eventhough a finite system, such as a 2024 laptop, is finite in computing power)
